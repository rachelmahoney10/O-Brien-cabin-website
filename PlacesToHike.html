      <p> Browns Creek Falls </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text"><p> Browns Creek Falls.  If you love waterfalls, Browns Creek Falls are a “must visit” place. Browns Creek flows in a canyon between Mt. White (13,667’) and Jones Peak (13,571’) and thanks to a series of large drops, creates a large and roaring waterfall. This would be an ideal spot for a picnic or to read book with the soothing sound of rushing water nearby. It is a 2.5 mile hike (one way) from the trailhead on Chaffee County Road 272. The trail travels through mountain forest with two log bridges over the creek near the falls. </p>
